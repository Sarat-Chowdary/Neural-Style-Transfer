Neural Style Transfer

You can run these models yourselves and have fun tuning the hyperparameters.

The first model is a VGG19 netwrok and the second one is inceptionv3.
Transfer learning is used in both cases and all layers are freezed.

The models created in this project were the product of referring 
through the paper 'A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style' by Leon A. Gatys, 
Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge. 

The paper talks about gram matrices and loss function and other 
tools required to complete a machine learning model using 
convolutional neural networks.

I throughly enjoyed completing this project
