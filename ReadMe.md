# Neural Style Transfer

* You can run these models yourselves and have fun tuning the hyperparameters.

* The first model is a VGG19 netwrok and the second one is inceptionv3.
* Transfer learning is used in both cases and all layers are freezed.

* The models created in this project were the product of referring 
through the paper 'A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style' by Leon A. Gatys, 
Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge. 

* Few output images are displayed below.
* I throughly enjoyed working on this project.

* The model is hosted at hugging face spaces at - https://huggingface.co/spaces/sarat-chowdary/NST-VGG19
